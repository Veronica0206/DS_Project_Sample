### There has been lots of talking about diversity in the workplace, especially in technology. The Head of HR at your company is very concerned about that and has asked you to analyze internal data about employees and see whether results suggest that the company is treating its employees fairly.

### Specifically, she gave you the following tasks:

#### (1) In the company there are 6 levels (described below). Identify, for each employee, her corresponding level.

-   Individual Contributors (IC): they don't manage anyone

-   Middle Managers (MM): they are the direct bosses of IC

-   Directors (D): they are the direct bosses of MM

-   VP: D direct bosses

-   Executives (E): VP direct bosses

-   CEO: The direct boss of E.

#### (2) How many people each employee manages? You should have a table with employee ids and the number of people managed. Consider that if John directly manages 2 people and these two people manage 5 people each, then we conclude that John manages 12 people.

#### (3) Build a model to predict the salary of each employee. Describe the main factors impacting employee salaries.

#### (4) Do you think the company has been treating its employees fairly? Do you see any bias? What are the next steps you would suggest to the Head of HR?

Create company hierarchical structure
-------------------------------------

Create data structure for the company structure and calculate the number of manages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output the number of manages of each ID

Visualize salary by potential factors
-------------------------------------

For the salary, we'll use the median value since that variable is
usually right-skewed.

Build a predictive model
------------------------

#### Split data to training and testing.

#### Build a random forest

For the random forest, we first need to decide the number of the tree as
well as the number of features randomly sampled at each split, both of
which can be done by visualization.
![](15.Diversity_in_the_Workplace_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)

    ## [1] 0.2605244 0.3287677 0.3222491 0.3104625 0.2990741

For this model, the number of 300 trees is good enough to see the
proportion of explained variance convergence in the graph. We will use
300 to shorten the training time. The number of features at each split
should be 2.

Then we refit the random forest.

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ##  randomForest(x = train_data[, -c(1, 3)], y = train_data$salary,      xtest = test_data[, -c(1, 3)], ytest = test_data$salary,      ntree = 500, mtry = 2, keep.forest = T) 
    ##                Type of random forest: regression
    ##                      Number of trees: 500
    ## No. of variables tried at each split: 2
    ## 
    ##           Mean of squared residuals: 5324705769
    ##                     % Var explained: 32.89
    ##                        Test set MSE: 5161596394
    ##                     % Var explained: 34.42

The proportion of explained variance of the training set and the test
set are 32.89% and 34.53%, respectively. We do not have overfitting
issue.

### Check variable importance

![](15.Diversity_in_the_Workplace_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)

Definitely the most important factor is the department since we do have
an outlier, CEO. Remove this observation and refit the model.

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ##  randomForest(x = train_data[, -c(1, 3)], y = train_data$salary,      xtest = test_data[, -c(1, 3)], ytest = test_data$salary,      ntree = 500, mtry = 2, keep.forest = T) 
    ##                Type of random forest: regression
    ##                      Number of trees: 500
    ## No. of variables tried at each split: 2
    ## 
    ##           Mean of squared residuals: 5286344251
    ##                     % Var explained: 32.78
    ##                        Test set MSE: 5163563334
    ##                     % Var explained: 34.96

### Recheck variable importance

![](15.Diversity_in_the_Workplace_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)

### Build a simple decision tree and check the 2 or 3 most important segaments

    ## n= 6599 
    ## 
    ## node), split, n, deviance, yval
    ##       * denotes terminal node
    ## 
    ## 1) root 6599 5.189743e+13 189773.80  
    ##   2) dept=HR 1096 7.682317e+11  85160.58 *
    ##   3) dept=engineering,marketing,sales 5503 3.674578e+13 210608.90  
    ##     6) dept=marketing,sales 3708 2.028442e+13 195001.60 *
    ##     7) dept=engineering 1795 1.369231e+13 242849.60 *

The tree splits at the department first, which aligns the result of the
variable importance of random forest. The second important feature is
the year of experience, which makes sense since more extended experience
deserves more salary. Also, we observed that the title and
signing\_bonus are not meaningful features in the model, which is also
reasonable since the random forest has been split on the years of
experience and the number of manages, there is not much left information
in the signing bonus and title.

### Do you think the company has been treating its employees fairly?

We do observed that the variable sex does affect salary, let's further
investigate the interaction between sex and other variables, such as
department, the number of manages, etc.

### By the interaction of title and sex

![](15.Diversity_in_the_Workplace_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)![](15.Diversity_in_the_Workplace_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-25-2.png)

In general, at each title level, the male median salary is higher than
the female median salary, so is the count.

### By degree and sex

![](15.Diversity_in_the_Workplace_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png)![](15.Diversity_in_the_Workplace_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-26-2.png)

In general, at each education level, the male median salary is higher
than the female median salary, so is the count.

### By department and sex

![](15.Diversity_in_the_Workplace_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)![](15.Diversity_in_the_Workplace_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-27-2.png)

Female employees outnumber male employees in HR and sales department.
And the median salary of male employees and female employees are the
same.

### By signing bonus and sex

![](15.Diversity_in_the_Workplace_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png)

The signing\_bonus rate among the male employees is relatively high than
that among female employees.

Based on the above plots, I would say the bias may exist. Possible next
steps may include:

-   Hiring more females employees, especially those in the Engineering
    department;

-   Make sure employee salaries are comparable if they are in the same
    department/with the same degree/with the same title.
