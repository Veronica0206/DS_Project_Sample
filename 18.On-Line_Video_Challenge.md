### Company XYZ is an online video streaming company, just like YouTube or Dailymotion. The Head of Product has identified as a major problem for the site a very high home page drop-off rate. That is, users come to the home-page and then leave the site without taking any action or watching any video. Since customer acquisition costs are very high, this is a huge problem: the company is spending a lot of money to acquire users who don't generate any revenue. Currently, the videos shown on the home page to new users are manually chosen. The Head of Product had this idea of creating a new recommended video section on the home page.

### He asked you the following:

#### (1) Classify each video into one the 3 categories below and explain your approach

-   "Hot": means trending up. These videos are candidate to be shown.

-   "Stable and Popular": video view counts are flat, but very high.
    These videos are candidates to be shown too.

-   "Everything else": these videos won't be shown.

#### (2) What are the main characteristics of the "hot videos"? After having identified the characteristics of the hot videos, how would you use this information from a product standpoint?

K-means with 3, 4, 5, and 6 clusters to identify the required classes

    ## 2   -0.424  0.728
    ## 3    1.498  0.845
    ## 4   -0.836  9.111

    ##   baseline  ratio

    ## 5    1.887  0.915
    ## 6   -0.597  0.722

Based on the about result, I decide the three classes:

-   "Hot": the first, third, and fourth cluster of k-means with *k* = 6
    which has positive week-over-week ratios;

-   "Stable and Popular": the fifth cluster of k-means with *k* = 6
    which has the highest (normalized) baseline and around 1
    week-over-week ratios;

-   "Everything else": the other two clusters of k-means with *k* = 6.

Identify features of hot vedios
-------------------------------

### Distribution of video length by cluster

### Distribution of vedio language by cluster

![](18.On-Line_Video_Challenge_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

### Distribution of upload date by cluster

![](18.On-Line_Video_Challenge_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

### Distribution of vedio quality by cluster

![](18.On-Line_Video_Challenge_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

### Simple tree

![](18.On-Line_Video_Challenge_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

Based on the splits and segments of the tree, the feature of hot vedio
is that its length lies between 4 and 5 minutes (244 seconds and 294
seconds).
