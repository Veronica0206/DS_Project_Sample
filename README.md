Machine Learning Project Sample Using R

The majority of these projects are my solution to the book ***A collection of Data Science Take-Home Challenges***.

Please **DON'T** contact me for the book and/or the dataset.

This repository is only for self-learning purpose. I am glad if my solution is helpful. Yet, I will **NOT** provide the original book or the data files. If you would like to practice, please visit <https://datamasked.com/>.
