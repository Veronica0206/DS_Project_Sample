# Machine Learning Project Demo 


## Part I: Research Project in Machine Learning :relieved:
### Project 1: 
**Title:** Regularized Learning with Networks of Features (August 2017--February 2018) <br>

**Description:** <br>
- Built a regularized learning with a network of features to handle the issue of high-dimensional feature space but a limited number of labeled entries. This proposed framework, regularized by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$L_{2}$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$L_{2}$" title="$L_{2}$" /></a> norm and prior knowledge regarding the similarity of features, profoundly improved the accuracy of prediction. <br>
- Implemented the model on 20 Newsgroups dataset and trained it through TensorFlow by minimizing the loss function. <br>

## Part II. My solution to the book ***A collection of Data Science Take-Home Challenges*** using R :wink: <br> 
The projects in this part are my solution to the book ***A collection of Data Science Take-Home Challenges***.

Please **DON'T** contact me for the book and/or the dataset.

This repository is only for self-learning and demonstration purpose. I am glad if my solution is helpful. Yet, I will **NOT** provide the original book or the data files. If you would like to practice, please visit <https://datamasked.com/>.
