Employee Retention
================

### We got employee data from a few companies. We have data about all employees who joined from 2011/01/24 to 2015/12/13. For each employee, we also know if they are still at the company as of 2015/12/13 or they have quit. Besides that, we have general info about the employee, such as avg salary during her tenure, dept, and yrs of experience.

### As said above, and the goal is to predict employee retention and understand its main drivers. Specifically, you should:

#### (1) Assume, for each company, that the headcount starts from zero on 2011/01/23. Estimate employee headcount, for each company, on each day, from 2011/01/24 to 2015/12/13. That is, if by 2012/03/02 2000 people have joined company 1 and 1000 of them have already quit, then company headcount on 2012/03/02 for company 1 would be 1000. You should create a table with 3 columns: day, employee\_headcount, company\_id.

#### (2) What are the main factors that drive employee churn? Do they make sense? Explain your findings.

#### (3) If you could add to this data set just one variable that could help explain employee churn, what would that be?

### (1) Assume, for each company, that the headcount starts from zero on 2011/01/23. Estimate employee headcount, for each company, on each day, from 2011/01/24 to 2015/12/13. That is, if by 2012/03/02 2000 people have joined company 1 and 1000 of them have already quit, then company headcount on 2012/03/02 for company 1 would be 1000. You should create a table with 3 columns: day, employee\_headcount, company\_id.

The general idea for this question: (1) Create a blank dataframe with any date between 2011/01/24 to 2015/12/13 and any company id (i.e., two columns) (2) Count how many employees joined/quitted for every company and every single date. At this step, if no one joined/quitted, it would return NA; we then need to replace the NA's with 0's. (3) Calculate the cumulative sum of joined employees and quitted employees, by taking a difference, we then get the number of headcounts.

    ##          day company_id employee_headcount
    ## 1 2011-01-24          1                 25
    ## 2 2011-01-24          2                 17
    ## 3 2011-01-24          3                  9
    ## 4 2011-01-24          4                 12
    ## 5 2011-01-24          5                  5
    ## 6 2011-01-24          6                  3

There are peaks around each employee year anniversary, especially the first two. And such patterns do not change by companies and departments.

![](3.Employee_Retention_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

It also peaks around the new year or a new fiscal year, which makes sense, since people prefer to wait until that time to get their bonus.

Based on the distribution (histogram), we would like to classify employees as short-term and long-term ones. From the histogram, we want to set up the cut-off at 15 months.

Salary is what matters the most. After all, it is likely to associate with other factors such as seniority, department, and company impact. So salary carries pretty much all information available.

It is interesting though that, looking at the root nodes, the way the tree split is: the employee has a higher probability of being an early quitter if salary is between 66, 000 and 224, 000. It suggests that people who make a lot of money and very little are not likely to quit.

### (3) If you could add to this data set just one variable that could help explain employee churn, what would that be?

Given how important is salary, I would definitely love to have as a variable the salary the employee who quit was offered in the next job. Otherwise, things like: promotions or raise received during the employee tenure would be interesting.

### Main conclusion

The major findings are that employees quit at year anniversaries or the beginning of years. Both cases make sense. Even if you don't like your current job, you often stay for 1 yr before quitting, and you often get stocks after 1 yr so it makes sense to wait. Also, the beginning of the year is well known to be the best time to change job: companies are hiring more and you often want to stay until the end of December to get the calendar year bonus. In addition, employees with low and high salaries are less likely to quit. Probably because employees with high salary are happy there and employees with low salary are not that marketable, so they have a hard time finding a new job.
