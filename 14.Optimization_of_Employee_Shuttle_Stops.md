### Company XYZ has decided to offer a shuttle bus to help its employees commute from San Francisco to Mountain View. The city of San Francisco has given the company a list of potential bus stop locations to choose from and asked to not have more than 10 stops within the city.

### You have been given the home address of all employees interested in taking the shuttle and asked to come up with the ten most efficient stops. While you have been given a certain freedom in defining what is "efficient", the general consensus within the company is that the most efficient way to select the bus stops is to minimize the overall walking distance between employee homes and the Ùè∞Älosest bus stop.

### Estimating all possible 10 stop combinations would require a lot of time (how many combinations would that be?). Therefore, your boss is fine with simplifying the problem and returning 10 stops that have a high probability of being the best stops.

    ## [1] TRUE

    ## 'data.frame':    2191 obs. of  2 variables:
    ##  $ address    : Factor w/ 1761 levels " B Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94112, USA",..: 1726 672 427 388 328 621 170 839 10 649 ...

Based on the output, it seems that, for the potential bus stops, one
street has been fixed, we need to decide the other street. Though we
have 2191 employees, we only have 1761 unique addresses. So we are going
to have the longitude and latitude of each individual address and of
potential bus stops.

Obtain longitude and latitude of these locations
------------------------------------------------

### Longitude and latitude of addresses

    unique_add <- as.data.frame(unclass(table(employee$address)))
    address_weights <- data.frame(address = rownames(unique_add),
                                  weights = unique_add$`unclass(table(employee$address))`)
    for (i in 1:nrow(address_weights)){
      loc <- geocode(as.character(address_weights$address[i]), source = "dsk")
      address_weights$longitude[i] <- loc[1]
      address_weights$latitude[i] <- loc[2]
    }
    employee <- employee %>% left_join(address_weights, by = "address")
    employee$longitude <- as.numeric(employee$longitude)
    employee$latitude <- as.numeric(employee$latitude)

### Longitude and latitude of potential bus stops

    for (i in 1:nrow(bus_stop)){
      loc <- geocode(paste0(bus_stop[i, 1], ", ", bus_stop[i, 2], ", ", "CA, USA"),
                     source = "google")
      bus_stop$longitude[i] <- loc[1]
      bus_stop$latitude[i] <- loc[2]
    }
    bus_stop$longitude <- as.numeric(bus_stop$longitude)
    bus_stop$latitude <- as.numeric(bus_stop$latitude)

To return 10 stops that have a high probability, we can separate the
employee's addresses to 10 clusters by k-means, then decide the stops by
minimizing the distance between the cluster centroids and the stops.

Based on the above plots, we noticed that the clusters of employee's
addresses are not well spherical-shaped and that some outliers exist in
the data, suggesting that we need to resort to trimmed k-means or other
cluster analysis with considering uncertainty.

### Method 1. Trimmed K-means

#### Step 1. Obtained centroids of 10 clusters

#### Step 2. For each centroid of the trimmed k-means, select the bus stop with a minimum distance

### Visualize bus stops selected by two approaches

![](14.Optimization_of_Employee_Shuttle_Stops_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

From the above plot, we see that some bus stops selected by two
approaches were overlapping. However, I do want to return the 10 bus
stops, which were chosen by the Gaussian mixture model. On the one hand,
this method considers distribution shapes which can handle outliers
relatively better so that we do not need to remove outliers (after all,
we want to decide the stops based on the address information of all
employees). On the other hand, the clustering result of k means highly
relies on the set of the initial status (i.e., sometimes, it just
returns the local optimal, especially for such large number of
clusters).
