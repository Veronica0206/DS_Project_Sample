Credit Card Transactions
================

### Company XYZ is a major credit card company. It has information about all the transactions that users make with their credit card. Your boss asks you to do the following:

#### (1) Your boss wants to identify those users that in your dataset never went above the monthly credit card limit (calendar month). The goal of this is to increase their limit automatically. Can you send him the list of Ids?

#### (2) On the other hand, she wants you to implement an algorithm that as soon as a user goes above her monthly limit, it triggers an alert so that the user can be notified about that. We assume here that at the beginning of a new month, user total money spent gets reset to zero (i.e., she pays the card fully at the end of each month). Build a function that for each day, returns a list of users who went above their credit card monthly limit on that day.

#### (3) Finally, your boss is very concerned about frauds cause they are a huge cost for credit card companies. She wants you to implement an unsupervised algorithm that returns all transactions that seem unusual and are worth being investigated further.

#### (1) Your boss wants to identify those users that in your dataset never went above the monthly credit card limit (calendar month). The goal of this is to automatically increase their limit. Can you send him the list of Ids?

##### Step 1: Sum all transaction dollar amount group by each credit card/month

    ## [1] "2015-07-31" "2015-10-30"

##### Step 2: Right join the general card information and the monthly amount

##### Step 3: Create a flag for each card in each month to indicate if the total amount was went above the limit (0-below the limit; 1-above the limit)

##### Step 4: Get the list that was requested

    ## [1] 862

The list contains 862 credit cards, and we print first records of it.

#### (2) On the other hand, she wants you to implement an algorithm that as soon as a user goes above her monthly limit, it triggers an alert so that the user can be notified about that. We assume here that at the beginning of a new month, user total money spent gets reset to zero (i.e., she pays the card fully at the end of each month). Build a function that for each day, returns a list of users who went above their credit card monthly limit on that day.

##### Step 1: Right join the dataset of the general information of credit cards and the transaction history

##### Step 2: Implement an algorithm that as soon as a user goes above her monthly limit, it triggers an alert so that the user can be notified about that

In our algorithm, it is the trigger when the flag of "alert" becomes true.

##### Step 3: Build a function to return a list of users who went above their credit card limit on that day.

##### Step 4: Exemplify the function

#### (3) Finally, your boss is very concerned about frauds cause they are a huge cost for credit card companies. She wants you to implement an unsupervised algorithm that returns all transactions that seem unusual and are worth being investigated further.

##### Step 1: Prepare features

To identify a fraud payment, we want to investigate several features, such as the amount of transaction, the local time, time difference between consecutive transactions, the location of one transaction, time difference between consecutive transactions, physical distance between consecutive transactions, and if such payment would let the total amount go above the credit limit. (1) The amount of a transaction: for example, if a credit card holder spends less than $300 most of the time, then it is suspect if he/she pays $1000. (2) Location of the payment: it is suspect if the transaction happens too away from the billing address. (3) Local time: it seems implausible to me if a holder spends money between local midnight and local 7 : 00 AM. (4) For a holder, he/she should always be aware of the credit limit; accordingly, if a transaction makes the expenditure go above the threshold, we need to investigate further. (5) Time/location difference between consecutive transactions: if the time difference between consecutive transactions is too small or the location distance is too large, it is suspected.

For the (2) and (3), since we do not have information concerning "travel notice", we then assume all credit holders stay in local to make a conservative analysis.

###### Amount: For the amount, we may just use the continuous amount

###### Subset dataset which would be used for building the models

For this project, we decided to use k-means clustering, which is the most commonly used unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dividing a given dataset into k clusters. Here, k represents the number of clusters and must be provided by the users. In our case, we want to set the k as 3 for the transaction with a regular pattern, a suspected pattern, and a highly suspected pattern, respectively. k-means is a good algorithm choice for the dataset since we do not knot the target labels making the problem unsupervised and there is pre-specified k value.
